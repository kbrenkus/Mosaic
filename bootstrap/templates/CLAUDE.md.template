# {Organization Name} — Instance Project Rules

## Artifact Distribution

|Target|Files|Format|Method|
|---|---|---|---|
|Claude.ai project knowledge|6 kernel .md files|.md|Manual upload|
|Copilot agent knowledge|Same 6 kernel files|.txt (generated)|Manual upload|
|Azure Blob (MCP retrieval)|All retrieval .md files|.md|Auto-synced|
|Claude.ai project instructions|From {ORG}-CLAUDE-PLATFORM-CONFIG.md|.txt|Paste into UI|
|Copilot Studio instructions|From {ORG}-COPILOT-PLATFORM-CONFIG.md|.txt|Paste into UI|

6 kernel files: 5 shared (MOSAIC-REASONING, {ORG}-INDEX, {ORG}-TAXONOMY-QUICK, {ORG}-A2A-QUICK, {ORG}-DOMAIN-ROUTER) + 1 agent-specific ({ORG}-CLAUDE-BEHAVIORS / {ORG}-COPILOT-BEHAVIORS). .txt copies for Copilot are generated artifacts in Upload/ only.

**End of every session:**
- Stage + sync: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/prepare_upload.ps1`
- No Azure CLI: append `-SkipBlob` flag
- Remind user to upload per {ORG}-MAINTENANCE §5F.

---

## MCP Server — `get_section` Tool

Azure Function exposes `get_section(file_name, section_ref)` as Claude.ai custom connector, reading `.md` files from Azure Blob Storage.

**Three hygiene rules:**
1. **Editing existing files** — no extra steps; `prepare_upload.ps1` syncs automatically.
2. **Adding new file to `reference/`** — no extra steps; blob sync glob picks it up.
3. **Adding file outside `reference/` needing `get_section`** — add to blob sync glob in `prepare_upload.ps1`, run `scripts/upload_to_blob.ps1` once to seed.

```

**`source-documents/` is the intake folder.** User drops external files here for integration. Files are inputs, not outputs. Clean up after integration.

---

## Cross-Reference Convention

- Cross-references use **base filenames without extension or path** (e.g., "see {ORG}-TEAMS").
- Keep .md in: manifest markers, file paths, changelog entries, table cells. Strip .md from: narrative references.

---

## Date Format Standard

- **Year+month+day** -> `YYYY-MM-DD`. **Year+month** -> `YYYY-MM`. **Month names as labels** -> natural language.

---

## Kernel Architecture & Budget

After editing kernel/agent config files, update {ORG}-MAINTENANCE §5E budget table. Claude.ai: ~200 KB. Copilot Studio: 8,000 chars. See MOSAIC-REASONING §6 and MOSAIC-PRINCIPLES for design principles.

---

## File Optimization Rules

Context-efficient formatting for all reference files (.md). Reduces token consumption 15-25% with zero reasoning quality loss.

**Format selection:**
- **YAML** for lookup/routing data: ID tables, stage mappings, aliases, capability matrices, troubleshooting. ~57% fewer tokens than equivalent markdown tables.
- **Minified markdown tables** for reasoning frameworks: authority types, entity types, decision trees. No cell padding (`|value|`), minimal separators (`|---|`).
- **Telegraphic prose** for procedural/routing content: remove articles, conjunctions, filler where meaning preserved.
- **Full prose** for reasoning exposition (MOSAIC-REASONING), behavioral directives, safety rules, "Do NOT" instructions, worked examples.

**Whitespace:** Single blank line between sections. Never double-blank. HRs between major sections only. No trailing whitespace.

**Tables:** `|---|` separators. `|value|` not `| value |`. Exception: numeric alignment.

**Examples:** 1-2 for simple patterns, 3 max for complex. Keep worked YAML examples for delta format.

**Never compress:** Reasoning exposition, behavioral safety instructions, data governance notes, markdown headers, delta trigger tables.

Apply when creating, editing, bootstrapping, or regenerating files. See MOSAIC-OPERATIONS §4.7 for methodology.

---

## Shared Reasoning Kernel

MOSAIC-REASONING.md is the **shared reasoning kernel** -- company-agnostic, distributable across instances.

- **Never add company-specific data** to MOSAIC-REASONING.md.
- **Versioned independently.** Bumps still get changelog entry in {ORG}-MAINTENANCE.
- **Instance files reference shared reasoning with pointers**, not duplicated content.
- **Prefer editing MOSAIC-REASONING** when content is company-agnostic.

---

## Pipeline Operations

Pipeline (`pipeline/`) runs in phases. See MOSAIC-OPERATIONS §4 for architecture.

**Running the pipeline** when user says "run pipeline"/"run maintenance" or Step 2a of §10.1:

1. **Phase 1 -- MCP Data Acquisition** (Claude Code):
   - Load MCP tools (deferred -- must load before calling)
   - Query live systems for current data
   - Write JSON snapshots to `pipeline/inputs/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
   - JSON schema: each file wraps array in named object (e.g., `{"deals": [...]}`)
   <!-- CUSTOMIZE: Document your specific MCP calls here:
        - Which systems to query
        - Which properties/fields to request
        - Which filters to apply (exclude closed, etc.)
        - What workspace/project IDs to use -->

2. **Phase 2 -- Transformation** (Python):
   `python pipeline/generate-domain-quick.py --date YYYY-MM-DD`

3. **Phase 3.5 -- Enrichment Queue** (Python):
   `python pipeline/generate_enrichment_queue.py`

4. **Run summary digest** -- read `pipeline/run-logs/run-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, present headline stats + action items + #1 enrichment candidate. Do NOT dump full summary.

If MCP tools fail, report and offer existing snapshots.

**Phase 3 -- Post-processing:** Present batch CSV by priority, mark consumed deltas complete, run `prepare_upload.ps1`.

---

## Git Workflow

**Session start:** `git pull` before any work. Claude Code checks and reminds.

**Session end:** After `prepare_upload.ps1`, stage with `git add`, commit with descriptive message, push.

**Safety rules:**
- **Never force push.** If git complains, stop and troubleshoot.
- **Merge conflicts:** Claude Code helps resolve. Never force through.

---

## Session Protocol

**Session start:**
1. CLAUDE.md auto-loaded. Check MEMORY.md for context.
2. `git pull` to sync latest.
3. If resuming, check task list and recent timestamps.
4. If user says "run maintenance"/"run monthly sync", start with pipeline, then §10.1 steps.

**During a session:**
- **Every version bump is a 3-part atomic operation:** (1) increment header version, (2) update {ORG}-MAINTENANCE §2.1/§2.2 manifest, (3) add changelog entry. Same edit session -- #1 drift source.
- **File structure changes:** update `prepare_upload.ps1`, {ORG}-MAINTENANCE §5F, {ORG}-INDEX §Related Reference Files.
- **No static counts in prose.** Reference source: "count = rows in [table]."
- Present analysis, wait for user direction before editing.

**Session end:** Run prepare_upload.ps1, remind user to upload per §5F, stage/commit/push.

---

## Analysis Checkpoint Rule

When multi-turn analysis produces refined conclusions, write brief to `memory/` before editing.

**Brief format** (`memory/<topic>.md`): What to do, What NOT to do, Key decisions, Status.

**Plan mode persistence (mandatory).** After plan approval, FIRST action is writing plan to `memory/`. Do not begin implementation until brief is written. Clean up completed briefs at session end.

---

## Plan Validation Requirement

Plans modifying reference files, restructuring content, or changing behavior must include validation design.

1. **Pre-test queries** (3-5) -- BEFORE implementation, scored against rubric
2. **Scoring rubric** -- dimensions with point scales, defined during planning
3. **Post-test queries** -- AFTER implementation, same rubric
4. **Acceptance criteria** -- e.g., "no regression, +2 minimum on depth"
5. **Conversation budget** -- max queries per test conversation

See MOSAIC-OPERATIONS §7 for testing architecture.

---

## Sensitivity Rule

**Never put sensitive identifiers** (tax IDs, account numbers) in CLAUDE.md, memory, or QUICK files. Define tiers in behavior files.

---

## Behavioral Parity Check

When modifying a behavioral directive, check if it applies to both agents. If yes, add to both. If no, document why.

---

## Agent Behavior Regression Rule

After editing behavior files, smoke test: 3 queries (easy/medium/hard) relevant to change. If any regresses, investigate before finalizing.

---

## Memory Management

- **MEMORY.md** always in system prompt -- keep under 150 lines. Use `memory/` topic files for details.
- **Delete superseded items.** Don't track versions -- authoritative in {ORG}-MAINTENANCE §2.1.
- **`memory/` for active briefs; `archive/` for completed.** Delete or move when done.

---

## PowerShell Coding Rules

- **No em dashes or non-ASCII characters** in .ps1 files -- even in comments.
- Avoid `($var text)` patterns in double-quoted strings.
- Use `-f` format operator or string concatenation for complex output strings.
