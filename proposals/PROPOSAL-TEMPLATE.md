# Mosaic Proposal: {Title}

**Submitted by:** {Instance Name} ({ORG})
**Date:** {DATE}
**Category:** {Reasoning Framework | Architecture Pattern | Protocol Enhancement | Design Principle | Tool Improvement}

---

## 1. Observation

What did you observe in your instance that suggests a shared improvement?

{Describe the pattern, problem, or insight you discovered during instance operation.}

## 2. Evidence

What concrete evidence supports this observation?

- **Query patterns:** {What kinds of queries revealed this?}
- **Agent behavior:** {How did agents perform before/after any local fix?}
- **Benchmark data:** {Test scores, if applicable}
- **Session examples:** {Specific interactions that demonstrate the issue or opportunity}

## 3. Universality Assessment

Is this observation specific to your organization, or does it apply broadly?

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Organization-specific?** | {Yes/No — if yes, this is an instance improvement, not a shared proposal} |
| **Domain-specific?** | {Yes/No — if yes, which domains?} |
| **Agent-specific?** | {Yes/No — does it only affect Claude, Copilot, or both?} |
| **Architecture-dependent?** | {Yes/No — does it depend on specific system integrations?} |

**Universality conclusion:** {One sentence on why this applies to other Mosaic instances.}

## 4. Proposed Change

What specific change to the shared methodology would address this?

**Target file(s):** {e.g., MOSAIC-REASONING.md §X, DOMAIN-BOOTSTRAP.md Phase Y}

**Change description:**
{Describe the specific edit, addition, or restructuring proposed.}

**Draft content (if applicable):**
```
{Include draft text for the proposed change, if you have it.}
```

## 5. Impact Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Existing instances** | {How does this affect instances that have already been deployed?} |
| **New instances** | {How does this affect future deployments?} |
| **Breaking changes?** | {Does this require instances to update their files?} |
| **Reasoning quality** | {Expected improvement to agent reasoning} |

## 6. Testing

How can this be validated?

- **Test queries:** {2-3 queries that would demonstrate the improvement}
- **Success criteria:** {What "better" looks like}
- **Regression risk:** {What might break}
